# FunctionasaServiceLandscape
FaaS Landscape

From open source projects to commercial software, we hope our landscape sheds light on the offerings and provides clarity on how they interrelate.  

We identified over 50 FaaS solutions within the ecosystem. The vast majority are open source and many are supported by a pre-existing business like Platform9’s Fission. As the market matures we expect to see an increasing number of enterprise-grade offerings beyond FaaS platforms from hyperscale cloud providers. 

Here are the listings. They need URLs to make them valuable
